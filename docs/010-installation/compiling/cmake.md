title: Compiling with cmake
---

myMPD uses cmake as build system.

Example: run cmake, build myMPD in the directory `build` and install the binaries in /usr/bin.

```sh
# Build as user
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
# binaries are placed in build/bin
make -C build
# Run install as root
sudo make -C build install
```

## cmake build types

- **Release, MinSizeRel**
    - Uses predefined compile and link options for a release build
    - Embed assets in binary
    - No debug output
    - Strips binary
- **RelWithDebInfo**
    - Uses predefined compile and link options for a release build
    - Embed assets in binary
    - No debug output
    - Included Debug info
- **Debug**
    - Uses predefined compile and link options for a debug build
    - Assets are served from the `htdocs` folder in the source directory
    - Debug output
    - Included Debug info
- **None**
    - Use this option to set your own compile and link options

## Unit tests

- Set `MYMPD_BUILD_TESTING=ON`
- Build as normal
- Run `make test`
